# Email_Spam_detection

We have implemented a machine learning model to predict whether a message is spam or not. Furthermore, we have also created a system that upon receipt of an email message, will automatically flag it as spam or not, based on the prediction obtained from the machine learning model.

The user should be able to get email with the label which says whether the email is a Spam or not. It will also give the confidence score with it predicts a certain output.
